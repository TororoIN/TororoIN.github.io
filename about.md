title: About me
---

I am Anthony. Currently, I'm studying in the Language Science Technology Master's program (Computational Linguistics) at the Department of Language Science & Technology at Universität des Saarlandes in Saarbrücken, Saarland, Germany. My interests lie in AI Alignment, Multimodality, Speech and Audio Processing and Mechanistic Interpretability. 

In my (limited) free time, I like to bike and check out new places and cool routes through forests and farms, play the guitar or just get crêpes and walk by the Saar.
